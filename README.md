# Laravel Vue Project

A very basic laravel project to show how to add vue and vue router to a laravel project.

A project I did for my blog story here
https://acrossverse.me/stories/vue-into-laravel-verse

## Install and run

```sh
> cd laravel-vue
> npm install
> composer install
> php artisan serve
> npm run dev
```
